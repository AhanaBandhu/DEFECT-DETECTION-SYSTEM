# DEFECT-DETECTION-SYSTEM

The Defect Detection System is a real-time surveillance application that activates the camera upon clicking the start button and captures images at regular or user-defined intervals. It compares each new image with the previous one to detect any defects such as cracks or surface changes. If no difference is found, the old image is replaced; if a defect is detected, it is highlighted. The system filters out background noise and lighting variations, making it suitable for monitoring structures like bridges where human inspection is difficult.
